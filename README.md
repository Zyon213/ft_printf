# ft_printf

Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough.


The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf().
You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that??
It is actually pretty cool 


You will discover a popular and versatile C function: printf(). This exercise is a great
opportunity to improve your programming skills. It is of moderate difficulty.
You will discover variadic functions in C.
The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and extensible code.
